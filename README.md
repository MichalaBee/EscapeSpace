Specifically regarding noise and/or sound reduced environments, and locations that focus on physical safety. 


## How to Use:
Upon open it will prompt the user to allow location data to be used, please select yes. There are four base options to select from.

  Emergency: Please select this option if you feel unsafe, this will provide directions to nearby locations with a police or strong public presence. These can include local police departments, hospitals, or other safe groups.

  Photosensitivity: Please select this option if you are feeling overstimulated by light. It will provide directions to nearby locations with dim lighting. These can include libraries and other similar locations.

  Noise Sensitivity: Please select this option if you are feeling overstimulated by noise prescence. It will provide directions to nearby quiet locations. These can include local parks, libraries, etc.

## Future Goals:
1. Increase help options: An example of this would be expand on photosensitivity by differentiated between locations with less light and locations with stable light (e.g. somewhere that will not trigger epilepsy). Another added option could focus on navigating to less populated areas.
2. Improve locational data: As of right now, the list of locations are restricted to Troy, NY. Additionally, its precision is limited.
3. Improve Functionality: Add a feature that will take user preference and automatically detect heightened noise or sound prescence. If a threshold is surpassed, it should prompt the user with directions.
